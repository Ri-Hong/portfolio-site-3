ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Ri Hong, a Computer Science enthusiast studying at the University of Waterloo. Recently, I wrapped up an invigorating co-op term at Microgreen Solar Corporation, where I spearheaded an ambitious full-stack AWS Cloud project. This initiative was centered around the processing of EnergyPak lithium battery data, encompassing a broad spectrum of technologies. This project consisted of everything from IoT solutions to databases and efficient caching mechanisms.

I'm also a hackathon enthusiast, having competed in 19, winning 9 of them. I believe that hackathons are a great way to build innovative projects, meet new people, and work under pressure. Nothing builds more comradery like working on a project at 4AM on 2h of sleep! 

I'm also pursuing an interest in AI, specifically NLP. I've a few projects using embeddings and RAG process. For example, I developed FlaimBrain, an LLM-powered study assistant that uses GPT4 for emebeddings, MongoDB for a vector database to allow for students to generate summaries, ask questions, and create mock exams. It won 4th place (out of 80) at Hack the Valley 8.

In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, swimming, and playing Clash of Clans. I'm also currently seeking Summer 2024 internships, so if you're looking for an innovative developer who excels under pressure, feel free to reach out to me. ðŸ˜€
